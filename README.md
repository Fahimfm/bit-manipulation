# bit-manipulation
Below is the description of how each file functions:
# Encoding
encoding.c file encodes the data by adding parity to it. It needs one text file as an input with some texts in it to run.
The output will be a file with the encoded data. This program takes two parameters to run.
The first parameter is the file name that will be read and the second parameter is the name of the file where the encoded bits will be written into. 
# Flipped bits
flipped.c file will read the encoded file generated by encoded.c and will randomly flip one bit per byte. After that, it will store it in a separate file. 
To be able to run this code, the user needs to provide two parameters where the first parameter is the input file name and the second parameter is the output file name where it will be written into.
