# bit-manipulation
Below is the description of how each file functions:
# Encoding
encoding.c file encodes the data by adding parity to it. It needs one text file as an input with some texts in it to run.
The output will be a file with the encoded data. This program takes two parameters to run.
The first parameter is the file name that will be read and the second parameter is the name of the file where the encoded bits will be written into. 
Example: main test.txt encoded.txt
# Flipped bits
flipbits.c file will read the encoded file generated by encoding.c and will randomly flip one bit per byte. After that, it will store it in a separate file. 
To be able to run this code, the user needs to provide two parameters where the first parameter is the input file name and the second parameter is the output file name where it will be written into.
Example: main encoded.txt flipped.txt 
# Decoding
decoding.c file simply corrects the bits that were flipped and decodes the bits into characters. The correction of the bits are performed by "parity bit checking".
After that, the output will be stored in a file. To run this file, two parameters are required like the last two files where the first parameter is the filename for reading and the second parameter is the filename for writing the decoded output.
Example: main flipped.txt decoded.txt
