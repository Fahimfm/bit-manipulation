Below is the description of how each file functions:
# Encoding
encoding.c file encodes the data by adding parity to it. It needs one text file as an input with some texts in it to run.
The output will be a file with the encoded data. This program takes two parameters to run.
The first parameter is the file name that will be read and the second parameter is the name of the file where the encoded bits will be written into.
